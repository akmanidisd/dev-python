# Python Virtual Environment

## Initial Setup

1. **_System Installation_**
2. **_Project Initialisation_**

# Everyday use

1. Activate **venv**

```bash
# cd project_folder
veactivate
```

2. Develop with VSCode

```bash
(.venv) $ code .
```

Now we are developing in **VSCode**.

We expect that it will use the correct Python environment.
Additionally the integration with Git will work as expected.

3. Deactivating **venv**

```bash
(.venv) $ deactivate

$ ...
```

See **_Project Use_** for additional information.
