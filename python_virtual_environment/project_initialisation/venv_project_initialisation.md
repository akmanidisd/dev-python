# venv Project Initialisation

```bash
veset
```

This will create the **_.venv_** directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.
<br/>Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
